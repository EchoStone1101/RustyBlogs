Welcome to a rusty corner of the Web where I post random stuff that are interesting to me, and hopefully to more.

## ICS Info

I am a TA for the 2023 Fall ICS course at Peking University. 
Here is a collection of useful information about the course:

## Rust Stuff

My experiences with Rust, and also my thoughts on the language. Mostly positive, as I am a bit of a Rust fanboy.
